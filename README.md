# OPTIONS

## GENERIC OPTIONS

__\--debug__ _n_ Change the verbosity level to _n_ (see ["DEBUG"](#debug)).

__\--forget__ Forget persistent options stored for the file (e.g. index
options).

__\--manual__ Removes automatic mode. This option is persistant.

__\--auto__ (default) Reinstates automatic mode. Use it to remove
__\--manual__ effect. Currently has the effect of __\--index__, __\--bibtex__
if no other index option (resp. bibliography) option was selected, and
starts the automatic discovery mode for `bibtex`.

## BIBTEX OPTIONS

__\--bibtex-file__ _somefile_ Marks some file to be an input for
`bibtex`. Can be given multiple times. Automatic mode will probably
spot all bibtex-able files anyway, so mostly useful in manual mode.

__\--bibtex__ Equivalent to __\--bibtex-file__ _file.aux_.

## INDEX OPTIONS

__\--index-file__ _somefile_ Marks some file to be an input for
`makeindex`. Can be given multiple times.

__\--index-file-suffix__ _extension_ The same as above, but for the file
_file_._extension_.

Each of the following option applies to the preceding `index-file`:

__\--index-style__ _somefile_ Corresponds to option __\-t__ of makeindex.

__\--index-output__ _somefile_ Corresponds to option __\-t__ of makeindex.

__\--index-output-suffix__ _extension_ The same as above, but for the file
_file_._extension_.

__\--index-options__ _string_ Corresponds to other options of makeindex,
separated by spaces, see ["QUOTING"](#quoting).

## DEPENDENCY OPTIONS

__\--depends__ List local files read by compilation and not overwritten
(`.tex`, `.cls`,...)

__\--internals__ List local files both output and read by compilation
(`.aux`...)

__\--outputs__ List local files output by compilation, but not read
(`.log`...).

__\--makefile__ _file.mk_ Outputs a makefile snippet included in
_file.mk_. The sections are self-delimited and replaced if already
present.

__\--make__ Same as `--makefile Makefile`.

__\--makefile-prefix__ Prepend a common prefix to all phony targets of the
makefile generated by the __\--makefile__ option.

__\--separator__ _string_ Use this quoted string as separator between
names instead of one space (see ["QUOTING"](#quoting)).

__\--gitignore__ Edit `./.gitignore` to ignore output and internals files.

## HELP OPTIONS

__\--help__ Generate this help (long version).

__\--usage__ Generate this help (short version).

__\--man__ Generate man page.

__\--nroff__ Generate man page in NROFF format.

# DESCRIPTION

compile-latex is a program that compiles a TeX file until it reaches a
fixed point. The program assumes that if all the inputs of a program are
the same, then not repeating this program is acceptable; and if any
input of a program changes, then the program is rerun.

compile-latex also manages makeindex. It supports the use of
the `multind` and `index` packages for multiple indexes; however, the
automatic mode only uses the `.idx` -> `.ind` standard index.

compile-latex also manages bibtex. It currently supports only simple
bibliography or multibib package (with hints); bibtopic, biblatex are
not supported).

compile-latex remembers from one compilation to another the index options
it was given. It is not necessary to repeat them (not harmful either).

compile-latex uses strace to determine the files accessed by a program.

# GIVING OPTIONS

Options may come from:

- the command line
- previous invocations (unless __\--forget__ is used)
- the file itself in specially formatted comments
- automatic mode

Some options coming from the command line and previous invocations will
be stored in the `file.md5` file and will be reused at later
invocations. They are the index options, bibtex options and the
__\--manual__ option (since __\--auto__ is on by default, it does not need
to be stored).

Comment lines in the file formatted as follows: one or more percent
char, zero or more spaces, the string `compile-latex`, one or more
spaces, the string `"option"`, zero or more spaces, the string `":"`
and one option (without any excess spaces), will be considered as an
option. These options will not be stored for later invocations, since
they are in the file anyway.

# QUOTING

Each option expects a single argument. Some may require spaces to
separate various parts (e.g. __\--index-options__). If one part needs
spaces (a filename, for example), use `%20` for the space inside the
part. Use `%25` for a litteral `%` and `%3B` for a `;`. Quoting
should almost never be necessary.

# DEBUG

Debug level varies from 0 (silent, except for results of __\--depends__ or
like options) to 7 (very verbose).

The default level is 1 and will print all time consuming operations.

Level 2 will print changed files before launching time consuming operations.

Level 3 will print all operations even skipped ones.

Level 5 will print changed checksums.

# EXAMPLES

    compile-latex file.tex

will compile `file.tex` as many times as necessary, processing index
and bibtex files as many times as necessary too (sometimes, bibtex index
have to be processed several times because of cross-references).

    compile-latex file.tex --manual --index-file-suffix adx \
    --index-output-suffix and \
    --index-options '-g -t /tmp/log%20indexation' \
    --index-file-suffix odx --index-output-suffix ond --bibtex

will compile `file.tex` and do some special treatment for auxiliary
programs. First, normal index `file.idx` will not be processed, as well
as support for multibib (only a normal `bibtex file` will be
issued). However, two index files ending in `.adx` and `.odx` (coming
from the `multind` package for example) will be processed to
`file.and` and the second one to `file.ond`, the first being indexed
with the `makeindex` options `-g` and `-t /tmp/log indexation`
(remark the space in the filename).

# BUGS

Generation of pictures by other programs is not supposed to be done by
`compile-latex`, unless the document uses `write18` to generate the
images (in which case, compile-latex will happily rerun the generation).

Makefile and gitignore options create files not safe to be invoked
outside their own directory. Files with weird names may cause problems.
